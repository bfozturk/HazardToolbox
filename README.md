# HazardToolbox 🚀  
**Open-Source Seismic Hazard Analysis & Earthquake Data Toolkit**  

HazardToolbox is a Python-based open-source toolbox designed for **probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA)**, featuring robust tools for **earthquake catalog integration, data cleaning, and hazard computation**.

## 🌍 Features  
✅ Fetch & parse earthquake data from catalogs (**USGS, ISC-GEM, NGA-West2**)  
✅ API integration & web crawlers for diverse seismic datasets  
✅ Advanced filtering & cleaning of seismic event records  
✅ Command-line interface (CLI) for easy usage  
✅ (Planned) Web API & visualization tools  

## ❓ Why HazardToolbox?  
There is currently **no unified package** that consolidates earthquake catalogs into a single workflow. HazardToolbox aims to bridge this gap by **streamlining data retrieval, cleaning, and hazard assessment** for researchers, engineers, and seismologists.
